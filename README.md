#### Playing tips

The game is a two player, the only difference is that a human plays against a computer.
Well that was the whole idea. But a ran into stuff that forced me to create a key for the user playing
to also control the bot; But this is just of shooting, the other stuff, the bot can figure out for itself.
Below are the keys

- Human player can use the upper arrow and down arrow to move player and shoot the opponent using the K_SPACE key
- The human player can also control the bot; only the part when you have to shoot yourself when playing against it
  This can be achieved using the K_LEFT arrow key

HAVE FUN!!
